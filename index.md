**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in the domain this quarter has been figuring out how we are going to test the effectiveness of our coding exercises. Initially the plan was to give them to DSC10 students week 6 of winter quarter but we quickly realized that that would be way too late and had to pivot. The earliest we could give them to DSC10 students would be week 6 because there are certain coding skills they need to have so to do it earlier we would need data science majors further along in their studies. It has also been interesting to think about how we are going to analyze the effectiveness of our exercises.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation I would like to pursue for the Quarter 2 project is the effectiveness of coding exercises when teaching about exponential probability density functions. I chose exponential functions because they aren't that intuitive and simulating values from them could aid with learning.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I'd make to the approach taken for my quarter 1 project would be spending more time making sure my exercises had a set probability concept. Initially I was making questions about tree diagrams but couldn't put into words how they'd be helpful so I switched to exponential functions.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

In project 2 I'm excited to be able to analyze the results of our exercises and assessment questions using standard regression modeling techniques.
